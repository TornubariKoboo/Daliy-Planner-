I built a day planner using the technologies javascript, html and css. This was a vital way to learn different concepts to create my day planner. I started the planner by using HTML and bootstrap to structure the build of the planner. I then used CSS to design the planner and the font of the text. Javascript was vital for the planner to work because it allowed me to make the planner responsive and activate. Overall, building my day planner was very insightful because  I used different concepts to create my day planner. Attached is the website to my day planner and also images are attached as well.
